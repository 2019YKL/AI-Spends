# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI-git-money is a real-time AI subscription cost tracker built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The name is a programmer pun combining git commands with "ÁªôÈí±" (give money). It displays today's consumption from AI subscriptions using smooth scrolling animations and includes an AI-powered roasting feature that mocks users' subscription habits.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server on localhost:3000
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

## Architecture & Design Principles

### Core Cost Calculation System
The app uses a **daily consumption model** (NOT monthly billing cycle). Each service has:
- `subscriptionPrice`: Fixed monthly cost in USD
- `billingStartDate`: When the current billing cycle began
- `billingCycle`: Number of days in cycle (typically 30)

**CRITICAL**: Real-time cost calculation works by:
1. **Time base**: Elapsed time since TODAY 00:00:00 (not billing start date)
2. Calculating daily cost rate: `subscriptionPrice / billingCycle`
3. Calculating cost per second: `dailyCost / (24 * 60 * 60)`
4. Current cost = elapsed seconds today √ó cost per second
5. Capping at daily maximum (not monthly)

### Smooth Number Animation System
Critical UX requirement: Numbers must **scroll smoothly, never jump or twitch**. All dynamic numbers use the `SmoothNumber` component which:
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps performance
- Implements easing with 6% incremental movement per frame
- Handles real-time incrementing based on `incrementPerSecond`
- Formats output with custom formatting functions

### UI Theme Design
The app uses a clean blue-and-gold theme with:
- Blue-based color palette with golden accents for currency displays
- Raycast-inspired premium gradients and glass morphism
- Dot pattern background for subtle texture
- Golden gradient (#DBB685) for money-related elements and progress bars
- Blue theme for UI components and navigation

### Service Toggle Architecture
Services can be toggled on/off using:
- `useServiceToggle` hook manages state
- Only active services (`isActive: true`) contribute to totals
- Real-time recalculation when services are toggled

### Service Categories and Organization
Services are organized into four main categories with clear visual separation:
- `ai-chat`: ü§ñ AIÂØπËØùÂä©Êâã (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- `code-editor`: üíª ÁºñÁ®ãÂºÄÂèëÂ∑•ÂÖ∑ (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, v0)
- `ai-image`: üé® AIÁªòÂõæ/ËßÜÈ¢ë (Midjourney, Dreamina, Hailuo, Vidu, Kling, Pixverse, Trae)
- `productivity`: ‚ö° Áîü‰∫ßÂäõÂ∑•ÂÖ∑ (Notion, Raycast, Figma)

### AI Roasting Feature
The app includes an AI-powered roasting system that mocks users' subscription habits:
- Uses OpenRouter API with DeepSeek model (`deepseek/deepseek-chat`)
- API key stored in environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- Generates programmer-culture specific roasts in Chinese "ÈõåÂ∞èÈ¨º" (bratty little sister) style
- Combines subscription data with tech industry memes and pain points
- Uses specific vocabulary like "ÊùÇÈ±º" (small fry), "ü©∑", "ü§°" emojis
- No user configuration required - API key is built-in

## Key Files & Components

### Data Layer
- `src/types/ai-services.ts`: Core TypeScript interfaces (AIService, CostCalculation, PricingTier)
- `src/lib/ai-services-data.ts`: Preset AI services (Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT, etc.)
- `src/lib/cost-calculator.ts`: Real-time cost calculation logic with currency conversion
- `src/lib/prompts.ts`: AI roasting prompt templates and system messages

### Hooks & State Management
- `src/hooks/useServiceToggle.ts`: Manages service state (active/inactive, tier selection)
- LocalStorage integration for persistent user preferences
- State synchronization between initial data and user customizations

### UI Components
- `src/components/SmoothNumber.tsx`: Smooth scrolling number animation with hydration error handling
- `src/components/RollingNumber.tsx`: Alternative number animation for hero section display
- `src/components/CostTrackingCard.tsx`: Individual service cards with pricing tiers (card mode)
- `src/components/ListCostTrackingCard.tsx`: Compact service list items (list mode)
- `src/components/SimpleCostTrackingCard.tsx`: Simplified service card variant
- `src/components/AIRoastChat.tsx`: AI roasting interface with DeepSeek integration
- `src/components/DotBackground.tsx`: Dot pattern background component
- `src/components/NewTypewriter.tsx`: Typewriter effect for hero text
- `src/components/Footer.tsx`: App footer component
- `src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Switch, Input, Label)

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/deepseek/chat/route.ts`: OpenRouter API integration for AI roasting
- `src/app/api/deepseek/validate/route.ts`: API key validation endpoint
- Uses environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for authentication
- Calls `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` with `deepseek/deepseek-chat:free` model

### Styling
- `src/app/globals.css`: Custom theme utilities, gradients, and animation effects
- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom utilities for animations and glass morphism
- Includes fire-style effects (legacy) and blue theme components
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### Main Page
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Dashboard with hero section and service grid
- Real-time updates every second for cost calculations
- Hero section uses golden gradient for currency display with typewriter effect
- Supports card/list view toggle and currency switching (USD/CNY/ZWL)
- Includes "back to top" button and service category organization

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Services
Add to `aiServices` array in `src/lib/ai-services-data.ts` with proper category classification:
- `ai-chat`: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- `ai-image`: Midjourney, Dreamina, Hailuo, Vidu, Kling, Pixverse, Trae
- `code-editor`: Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, v0
- `productivity`: Notion, Raycast, Figma

Each service requires:
- Unique `id` and `name`
- Icon file in `/public/icon/` directory (preferably SVG)
- Background `color` using Tailwind classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500`)
- `subscriptionPrice` as default monthly cost in USD
- `category` for proper grouping
- Optional `pricingTiers` array for multiple subscription levels

### Number Display Rules
ALL dynamic numbers must use smooth animation components. Two main options:
- `SmoothNumber`: For most real-time updating numbers with smooth transitions
- `RollingNumber`: For hero section large display with real-time incrementing
Key props for both:
- `value`: Current value to display
- `incrementPerSecond`: How much to increment per second (0 for static values)
- `formatFn`: Custom formatter (use `formatCurrency` or `formatCurrencyPrecise`)
- Use `suppressHydrationWarning` to prevent SSR/client mismatch issues

### UI Design Requirements
- Money-related elements use golden gradient for currency amounts and large displays
- Service categories are clearly separated with emoji prefixes and proper spacing
- Blue theme for UI components (buttons, switches, navigation)
- Dot pattern background provides subtle texture
- Hero section displays large scrolling total with golden gradient
- Card/list view toggle allows users to switch between grid and compact layouts
- Currency selector supports USD, CNY, and ZWL with real-time conversion
- localStorage integration for preserving user preferences (currency, view mode, service states)

## Technical Constraints

- Next.js 14 with App Router (not Pages Router)
- All components must be client-side (`'use client'`) for real-time updates
- Uses shadcn/ui component system
- No external animation libraries - custom `requestAnimationFrame` implementation
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Multi-currency support (USD, CNY, ZWL) with real-time conversion
- All dynamic numbers must use animation components with `suppressHydrationWarning` to prevent SSR issues
- LocalStorage integration for user preferences (requires mounted state checks)
- Framer Motion available for advanced animations if needed

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:
```
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... # OpenRouter API key for AI roasting feature
