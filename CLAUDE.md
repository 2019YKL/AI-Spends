# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI-git-money is a real-time AI subscription cost tracker built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The name is a programmer pun combining git commands with "ÁªôÈí±" (give money). It calculates and displays live "burn rates" for AI service subscriptions using smooth scrolling animations to show money being spent per second/minute/hour.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server on localhost:3000
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
```

## Architecture & Design Principles

### Core Cost Calculation System
The app uses a **daily consumption model** (NOT monthly billing cycle). Each service has:
- `subscriptionPrice`: Fixed monthly cost in USD
- `billingStartDate`: When the current billing cycle began
- `billingCycle`: Number of days in cycle (typically 30)

**CRITICAL**: Real-time cost calculation works by:
1. **Time base**: Elapsed time since TODAY 00:00:00 (not billing start date)
2. Calculating daily cost rate: `subscriptionPrice / billingCycle`
3. Calculating cost per second: `dailyCost / (24 * 60 * 60)`
4. Current cost = elapsed seconds today √ó cost per second
5. Capping at daily maximum (not monthly)

### Smooth Number Animation System
Critical UX requirement: Numbers must **scroll smoothly, never jump or twitch**. All dynamic numbers use the `SmoothNumber` component which:
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps performance
- Implements easing with 6% incremental movement per frame
- Handles real-time incrementing based on `incrementPerSecond`
- Formats output with custom formatting functions

### Fire Theme Design
The app uses a "burning money" fire theme with:
- Black-red color palette (NOT purple/blue)
- Raycast-inspired premium gradients and glass morphism
- Advanced CSS utilities in `globals.css` for fire effects
- All numbers should have fire-themed glowing text effects

### Service Toggle Architecture
Services can be toggled on/off using:
- `useServiceToggle` hook manages state
- Only active services (`isActive: true`) contribute to totals
- Real-time recalculation when services are toggled

### AI Roasting Feature
The app includes an AI-powered roasting system that mocks users' subscription habits:
- Uses OpenRouter API with DeepSeek model (`deepseek/deepseek-chat`)
- API key stored in environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`
- Generates programmer-culture specific roasts in Chinese "ÈõåÂ∞èÈ¨º" (bratty little sister) style
- Combines subscription data with tech industry memes and pain points
- Uses specific vocabulary like "ÊùÇÈ±º" (small fry), "ü©∑", "ü§°" emojis

## Key Files & Components

### Data Layer
- `src/types/ai-services.ts`: Core TypeScript interfaces
- `src/lib/ai-services-data.ts`: Preset AI services (Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT, etc.)
- `src/lib/cost-calculator.ts`: Real-time cost calculation logic

### UI Components
- `src/components/SmoothNumber.tsx`: Smooth scrolling number animation with hydration error handling
- `src/components/CostTrackingCard.tsx`: Individual service cards with pricing tiers
- `src/components/AIRoastChat.tsx`: AI roasting interface with DeepSeek integration
- `src/components/DotBackground.tsx`: Dot pattern background component
- `src/components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Switch)

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/deepseek/chat/route.ts`: OpenRouter API integration for AI roasting
- Uses environment variable `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for authentication
- Calls `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` with `deepseek/deepseek-chat` model

### Styling
- `src/app/globals.css`: Fire theme utilities, advanced gradients
- Uses Tailwind CSS with custom fire-themed utilities
- Glass morphism effects with `fire-glass-card` class

### Main Page
- `src/app/page.tsx`: Dashboard with hero section and service grid
- Real-time clock updates every second
- Hero section uses premium fire gradients with floating orbs

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Services
Add to `aiServices` array in `src/lib/ai-services-data.ts` with proper category classification:
- `ai-chat`: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
- `ai-image`: Midjourney, DALL-E  
- `code-editor`: Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot
- `productivity`: General productivity tools

### Number Display Rules
ALL dynamic numbers must use `SmoothNumber` component. Never display raw calculated values directly. Key props:
- `value`: Current value to display
- `incrementPerSecond`: How much to increment per second (0 for static values)
- `formatFn`: Custom formatter (use `formatCurrency` or `formatCurrencyPrecise`)

### Fire Theme Requirements
- Use black-red color scheme throughout
- Apply fire glow effects to important numbers
- Maintain glass morphism aesthetic
- Floating animations should be subtle (6s ease-in-out)

## Technical Constraints

- Next.js 14 with App Router (not Pages Router)
- All components must be client-side (`'use client'`) for real-time updates
- Uses shadcn/ui component system
- No external animation libraries - custom `requestAnimationFrame` implementation
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
